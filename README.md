# GlobalVars
## ScratchX expermimental extension.
This extension will give you the power of cloud variables but fully global instead of just in your own project these variables are known as **Global Variables** which give you the power to share your data between two projects!

The variable is avaliable to everyone to get and see but in future updates variable ID'S will be added to ensure only your project(s) has access to the variables.
